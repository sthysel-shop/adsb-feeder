#+title: ADS-B feeder

This is the box hosting the PiAware hardware for the [[https://flightaware.com/adsb/stats/user/sthysel][FlightAware]] system. Is
mounted in my attic, which has a tin roof. The ADS-B antenna is mounted close by
vertically up on the same mount as the HF TV antenna.

The tin is precariously mounted on a cross beam. Power and wired ethernet is fed in from below.

Everybody like shortbread. Some ventilation holes for bugs to freely travel. Also heat to escape.
