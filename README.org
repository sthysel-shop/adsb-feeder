#+title: ADS-B feeder

This is the box hosting the PiAware hardware for the [[https://flightaware.com/adsb/stats/user/sthysel][FlightAware]] system. Is
mounted in my attic, which has a tin roof. The ADS-B antenna is mounted close by
vertically up on the same mount as the HF TV antenna.

The tin is precariously mounted on a cross beam. Power and wired ethernet is fed
in from below.

The tin was used because its unlikely to catch fire, and should be able to
contain any electrical fires. Its also a faraday cage of sorts, but for that to
be really effective the pi needs to be more isolated from the SDR internally,
and the tin needs to be grounded. All of that may improve reception a bit.

Everybody like shortbread. Some ventilation holes for bugs to freely travel. Also heat to escape.

   - Inline Ethernet surge arrestor to help protect the rest of the network
     against lightning strikes
